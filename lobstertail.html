        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (4 ounce) lobster tails</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, grated</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>2 wedges lemon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Butterfly lobster tails by cutting lengthwise through the centers of the hard top shells and meat with kitchen shears. Cut to, but not through, the bottoms of the shells. Spread the tail halves apart. Place tails in the air fryer basket with lobster meat facing up.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add lemon zest and garlic; heat until garlic is tender, about 30 seconds. Transfer 2 tablespoons of butter mixture to a small bowl and brush onto lobster tails; discard any remaining brushed butter to avoid contamination from uncooked lobster. Season lobster with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook in an air fryer at 380 degrees F (195 degrees C) until lobster meat is opaque, 5 to 7 minutes. Spoon reserved butter from the saucepan over lobster meat. Top with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cook's Notes</h2>
        <p>You can use frozen lobster tails, just thaw them first before proceeding with instructions.</p>
